# colloect important notes for setting basic node.js https server

How HTTPS Works
  Client initiates a secure connection to the server
  Server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the client
  Client verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
  Encrypted session is established using asymmetric encryption
  Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data transfer

Note: Modern HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The terms are often used interchangeably, but SSL is now considered deprecated.

// Using require()
const https = require('https');

// Using import (requires "type": "module" in package.json) | Node.js version 14+
import https from 'https';

Note: The main difference in usage is that HTTPS requires SSL/TLS certificates, while HTTP does not.
