# colloect important notes for setting basic node.js https server

How HTTPS Works
  Client initiates a secure connection to the server
  Server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the client
  Client verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
  Encrypted session is established using asymmetric encryption
  Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data transfer
