and then deploy on Cloud such as on a Kuberneste cluster (aka K8S)

Micro service can be configured so that outside can talk/call eg: via a Web API

Most of applications nowadays have been moving to cloud using micro service methodology

Understanding cloud principles is also compulsory for learning AI systems creating nowadays
